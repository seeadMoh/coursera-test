     <h2>Applications of Javascript Programming</h2>
     <p>As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
     <ul>
		 <li><b>Client side validation</b> - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.</li>
